# Kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of the Project
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While we worked on this project it became clear that this was an imersive lesson to ensure that we knew the basics of a more advanced world of Excel. This would boost our own skill levels higher to be able to better understand the more complex and more in-depth lessons ahead. The data provided offered breathtaking information to which we were able to leverage our own skills and, while integrating scaffolding learning, <img src="https://github.com/ChristianShada/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Google-Fu5.jpg" align="right" width="250"> we were able to build upon what we had learned as we went through the module. It was important for us to also utilize many different resources including our classmates, TA's, tutors, and a little Google-Fu.</p> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As far as the purpose of this analysis, it was important for our client to see what made sence come time to laungh her camaigns again next year. The most chalanging thing was needing to ask the right questions and what would have been best for the client to make a valid and credible decision based on the information.
## Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While this seems like it would be a simple task, identifying lines and lines of data would take nearly a month to identify trends and patterns. With the ability to look at these through different lenses based on excel rules/arguments, I was able to easily identify my conclusion with more confidence through utilizing the graphic displays. 
#### Challenges
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the largest challenges that I had going into it was the countifs fucntion in Excel. It took me quite the while to understand the concept. My biggest resource was checking in with my peers and closely after was the aforementioned Google-Fu and YouTube. This helped me understand the logic behind what I needed to be looking for. When I finally got it I threw my hands in the air and I had to tell my wife about it. Teaching it to her really solidified the idea. Another challenge for me was listneing to others get ahead whilst still working on this Module. I like to be ahead of the game. I pride myself on it. After stepping away from the computer for a little bit, I was able to realize that we all go at different paces and that there is a great support system in place for me and I can acess that at any time.
## Results
### Conclusions of the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While looking at the teater Outcomes Based on Launch Date data graph, it is easy to see a pattern of when the hight of attendance is for the successful titles. Even with the titles that did not meet their financial goals, you can see where they peaked out and understand the eb and flow of both successful and failed outcomes. Another conclusion that you might reach withthe data provided, is when you might want to begin the theater shows, and when you might want to shut them down. <img src="https://github.com/ChristianShada/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Outcomes%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png" align="left" width="500"> Lookin at the January to March peak. That is just when a show started and the initial spike. Then once the rubber started hitting the road and the show was gaining traction, then people started going to the shows. Ehn it bottomed out after Labor Day weekend. So once might find that you can shorten up your seaon and protect your bottom line by only producing shows from March to the end of August.
### Outcomes Based on Goals Conclusion
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This particular set of data is not congruent with the other data set, while almost defying it. Looking at the grapgh itself, one might derive from it that only showing the Percent Successful, also shows a mirror verson of the Percent Successful. Where only one data set would really be needed. For instance, if you knew that 70 percent of the shows were successful against its goals, you would then know that 30 percent of it was uncessucful. You really wouldn't need a graph to show you. But if you are going to look at one of the percentage that was successful against its goals, overall this was not a very successful campaign. The majority of the shows, based on its goals, failed per the uptick of the green line and the downward slope of the blue. 
### There is a summary of the limitations of the dataset, and there is a recommnedation for additional tables or graphs.
