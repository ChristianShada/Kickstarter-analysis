# Kickstarter-analysis
## Overview of the Project
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While we worked on this project it became clear that this was an imersive lesson to ensure that we knew the basics of a more advanced world of Excel. This would boost our own skill levels higher to be able to better understand the more complex and more in-depth lessons ahead. The data provided offered breathtaking information to which we were able to leverage our own skills and, while integrating scaffolding learning, <img src="https://github.com/ChristianShada/Kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Google-Fu5.jpg" align="right" width="250"> we were able to build upon what we had learned as we went through the module. It was important for us to also utilize many different resources including our classmates, TA's, tutors, and a little Google-Fu.</p> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As far as the purpose of this analysis, it was important for our client to see what made sence come time to laungh her camaigns again next year. The most chalanging thing was needing to ask the right questions and what would have been best for the client to make a valid and credible decision based on the information.
## Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While this seems like it would be a simple task, identifying lines and lines of data would take nearly a month to identify trends and patterns. With the ability to look at these through different lenses based on excel rules/arguments, I was able to easily identify my conclusion with more confidence through utilizing the graphic displays. 
#### Challenges
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;One of the largest challenges that I had going into it was the =countifs in Excel. It took me quite the while to understand those.
